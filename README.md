# DesignPatterns

## Factory:
1- Simple Factory: The Simple Factory pattern is a design pattern in which a method creates objects based on a parameter provided to it. The main goal of this pattern is to encapsulate the object creation logic in a single place, making the code more maintainable and reducing coupling between the client code (which requests objects) and the classes that are instantiated. So, a single class is responsible for object creation, typically via a static method.

2- Factory  Method: Object creation is deferred to subclasses, which implement the factory method to create objects based on their logic.

3- Abstract Factory: The "Factory of Factories" allows clients to work with related objects while abstracting away the details of their creations.
